        User can input Employee name into database
          I have used Database first approach
            1. Created the database
            2. Created a visual studio project solution
            3. Added ADO.NET Entity Data Model
            4. Created an entity class that matches the database to hold the information from the database
            5. Started Coding
            
         Note: Dont forget to change the connection string
